          Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw
          something than to explain how to draw it. […]However, once we have
          successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general
          manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in
          different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise
          explanation turns out to be worth it

          This quote speaks to my visual design practice so well, as we are
          actually creating our own rules and formula for our own design. In
          opposed to freehanded design, creating design system actively involves
          mathematics allow us to think ahead of what are the possibilities can
          be generated through pre-defined visual elements. I have always been
          interested in experimenting design system and expand the visual design
          through . Finally, this piece of writing really provides me some good
          text references to learn the theory of design system. Building your

          “In visual perception a color is almost never seen as it really is -
          as it physically is. This fact makes color the most relative medium in
          art.” Rather than beginning a fruitless search for such divine
          proportions to serve a gross simplification of the world, we will
          instead focus on a more concrete history of how technology long has
          inspired designers to use geometric constraints to ease the burden of
          their work.
        </h2>
        <p>
          When we are first exposed to art and designed, we are often urged to
          study the color theory and design rules as they are the bible of what
          respectable art and design should be. As it turned out, the rules are
          not science. Rather, they are just some arbitrary result of our
          ancestor's experimentation. Knowing this also emancipates the
          designers from having to abide to strict conventions as now I feel
          like I can be more confident and bold of my own experimentation on the
          rules of visual design.

          “Anyone willing to take the necessary trouble will find that, with the
          aid of the grid system, he is better fitted to find a solution to his
          design problems which is functional, logical and also more
          aesthetically pleasing”<br />

          One can imagine how the critics at the time must have sounded a lot
          like what we hear today about the computer: That these new machines
          constrain the artist and make the design products uniform.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I cant agree with the statement more as I understand the importance of
          the rules as I use them everyday in my own design. As much as I love
          using a design system, I still question what are the implications of
          the rules themselves. The moment the rules are established, it also
          means certain things are eliminated or forced to conform the
          universality of the design itself. It may not be entirely relevant,
          but I recently encountered an article that talks about the qwerty
          keyboard has impaired Chinese speaking population's ability to write
          Chinese characters, since the keyboard systems only suggest the
          phonetics of Chinese and does not require the user to know how to
          write a character. QWERTY is the invention of the west and it has
          become the standard and rules of the computer. Therefore, when we try
          to include other languages and culture into the standardized system, a
          different culture has to force itself to fit in the system and we
          sometimes cannot foresee the ramifications of it.

          This quote not only applies to training of AI but also the design
          process. A lot of design that goes out of hand after they are released
          into the world because they were not tested in a situation hasn't
          seen. But this also leads to another question, so how do we envisage
          those scenarios without dropping the AI/product to the unknown
          territory. How do we foresee the unexpected? Is there a way to solve
          those problems rapidly once it occurs in real life?

          Not only do we have to be super careful about what we are asking for,
          I think we also have to recognize the fact that whatever we feed into
          the system is mostly biased due to our own rigid perception of the
          world. If the thing we ask is rigid, then the feedback we get from the
          computer is going to be rigid too.

          I often forgot computers are actually not as smart as we want them to
          be. They can only process past incidents and make predictions based on
          past experience. They don't know how to make something new and they
          definitely will not tell us the best decisions. I often wonder if
          there is a way to break the algorithm on Spotify. At first, Spotify
          seems to recommend me the music that I will really like. However, now
          it kinda repeats itself and keep suggesting the same music I do not
          enjoy repeatedly. It does not know what I like and it can only predict
          what I may like. At the end, I have to go out of my way to find the
          music that I will enjoy rather than letting the machine decides it for

          I have been wondering about this question since I arrived at the MDP.
          We make so much work that requires comprehensive research on specific
          topics especially when it comes to projects that deals with science,
          technology and speculative future (which is almost everything that we
          do at MDP). Just like earlier in the chapter that Ginsberg mentioned
          about deskilling for adaptability, deskilling is often widely adopted
          when it comes to learning about technology, for example visual coding
          softwares. I understand that we could not be the expert in every
          single field that we are interested but I also wonder how much do we
          need to know in order to have credible, sensible opinions on certain
          topics? How much do I need to know about technology so I can tell
          people that I work with creative technology? The accessibility to
          specific expertise often comes with compromises of the depth of
          knowledge.

          Whenever we are trying to develop a system, we first make a draft how
          system would work based on specific theories and models that we are
          looking for. However, since the entire structure could easily be
          overthrown by latency and discrepancy in the flow of the system, I
          really wonder if there is an efficient way to identify the source of
          discrepancy in larger and even more complex structures or is there
          some kind of "activity monitor" for systems to inspect the flows of
          the system?

          Even through the examples given in the book we can see how the model
          of car sales is similar to the water sewage of the bath tub, which I
          found quite fascinating and wonder if I can identify the application
          of that model in other usage in our everyday life as well. It is quite
          interesting to see that how the same model could be apply to something
          so big like the population system and something comparatively minor
          like the heating system in our house. I wish I can see more examples
          of these models.

          I will just point out that, according to the dynamics of depletion,
          the larger the stock of initial resources, the more new discoveries,
          the longer the growth loops elude the control loops, and the higher
          the capital stock and its extraction rate grow, and the earlier,
          faster, and farther will be the economic fall on the back side of the
          production peak. Unless, perhaps, the economy can learn to operate
          entirely from renewable resources.

          This probably comes out more of a rant rather a direct response to the
          text. Since we clearly understand the fact that our economy model is
          built based on finite resources and the dynamics of depletion based on
          the model, I really wonder why we are not tackling the future problems
          that stem from our current model and take little measures to counter
          the future fall back of the production peak. Is it simply about the
          instant gratification and dismissing the future ramification? Are we
          really that shorttsighted?

          I started contemplate on a lot of terminologies after I learned more
          about critical theories. A term could have multiple meanings if we
          approach it from different field of studies and serve as an entirely
          different signifier in different context. I found this quote
          interesting because it also suggest how a designer perceives design
          and experiment is not the way biologists perceive design and
          experiment. Does that mean bio-design is not design? And how do we
          think about bio-design critically through the framework of design and

          I have been wondering about this question since I arrived at the MDP.
          We make so much work that requires comprehensive research on specific
          topics especially when it comes to projects that deals with science,
          technology and speculative future (which is almost everything that we
          do at MDP). Just like earlier in the chapter that Ginsberg mentioned
          about deskilling for adaptability, deskilling is often widely adopted
          when it comes to learning about technology, for example visual coding
          softwares. I understand that we could not be the expert in every
          single field that we are interested but I also wonder how much do we
          need to know in order to have credible, sensible opinions on certain
          topics? How much do I need to know about technology so I can tell
          people that I work with creative technology? The accessibility to
          specific expertise often comes with compromises of the depth of
          knowledge.

          I am curious about the fact that the moment we consider the bio-design

          implication of meat especially when I order fried chicken and see that

          lifespan of the product/life form? Are we creating lives soley for our

          Designers are sometimes treated like machines, and we are just tools
          to make things beautiful and efficient. I know most of the jobs are
          paid by hours but for design it is especially so. When we are making a
          design project people pay us by hours and they are always wondering
          where did their money go. Speaking from my own experience working in a
          design studio. I was often asked not to spend too much time on
          conceptualizing the design because we have to manually log how much
          time we spend on specific tasks. The idea of how time plays a role in
          creative process.But I also relate this back to a conversation we had
          about the most original ideas. Even though everything is a remix of a
          previous creation, we are still competing to release the idea before
          our competitors. If we are not fast enough someone else will release a
          similar design before us andd we will not be able to claim to have the
          most original ideas.

          I see many designers dread messiness. We always want things that are

          unprofessional and undesirable. I sometimes concern people will
          dismiss my work because the style is too messy and not slick. It seems
          like people dont have time to read into the implication of those
          design choices. Everything has to fit into the box, the template, the
          existed system.

        <p>
          I think that is the most disconcerting implication of designs. The
          people who are going to be affected by the products are usually not
          included in the design process. Very often, outreaching potential
          users are labor intensive, time consuming and economically
          inefficient, and it just doesn't seem "worth it" to include that in
          the production. On the other hand, I agree with the writer that we
          should stand up for the people who are going to be negatively impacted
          by the design. However, I think if those who are impacted are included
          in the process, the designers do not have to play the roles of hero
          who voice for them as the evidence will speak for themselves.
